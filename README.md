Zoom, Pinch, mark(edit), Save enabled imageView in Android


When you want to zoom/pinch an imageView in android, you have plenty of  straight implementation available on web like http://developer.android.com/training/animation/zoom.html. Unfortunately, most of the implementations zoom image from top/left corner and do not keep fingers of user as center point, which should be the desired way of zoom/pinch(for me at-lease). so i found https://github.com/jasonpolites/gesture-imageview  more suitable. Although it is a bit lengthy, but i least bother about that as it is very straight to incorporate in your code.

So zoom, pinch and scrolling of imageView  was already there. Addition thing you will get  here is :

1) Mark/Annotate image at the user touched point on screen. 

2) Save this edited image into SD Card.
